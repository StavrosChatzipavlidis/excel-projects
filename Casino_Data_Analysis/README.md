# Gambling Data Analysis Using Excel

## Overview
This project involves the analysis of gambling transaction data using various **Excel formulas** and **tools**. The objective was to extract insights related to deposit patterns, player behavior, and game popularity. The dataset used in this analysis was a mock (toy) dataset, allowing me to showcase my data analysis skills in a time-limited online assessment.

## Methodology

In this project, I used a combination of Excel formulas, sub-tables, and pivot tables to answer specific business-related questions. Below are the key formulas and tools utilized:

- **SUMIFS** and **AVERAGEIF**: To compute conditional totals and averages, such as determining total deposits by region or average deposit per player.
- **FILTER**: Used to extract data subsets based on specific conditions, such as identifying outliers or filtering transactions from particular regions.
- **INDEX** and **MODE**: Applied to find the most frequent occurrences, such as the most popular games and the highest transaction amounts.
- **VLOOKUP**: To match and retrieve data between different tables, particularly for identifying missing transactions or calculating costs.
- **IF**: Used for conditional logic, allowing calculations based on whether certain criteria are met.
- **MATCH** and **TEXT**: Utilized to find the position of items in a range and format data for date comparisons.
- **ROW**: To return the row number of a reference, useful in conjunction with other functions.
- **ISNUMBER** and **SEARCH**: Employed to check for numeric values and search for specific text within a dataset.
- **IFERROR**: Used to handle errors gracefully in calculations, providing default outputs when errors occur.
- **LEFT**: To extract the first few characters of a string, useful for processing identifiers.
- 
- **Pivot Tables**: For summarizing large datasets, creating dynamic reports on deposits, popular games, and transaction volumes.
- **Sub-tables**: Utilized to organize data and make it more manageable for complex formula operations and calculations.
- **Outlier Detection**: Identified outlier transactions based on statistical techniques like standard deviation.
  
## Project Highlights

- Comprehensive analysis of deposit patterns across multiple regions (UK, Japan, Germany).
- Identification of the top 10 most popular games and the most frequent transactions using `MODE` and `INDEX`.
- Calculation of average bets per spin and total deposits using `AVERAGEIF` and `SUMIFS`.
- Detection of outlier transactions and identification of missing transactions using **VLOOKUP** and **FILTER**.
- Analysis of player behavior based on transaction amounts and geographic location.
- Calculation of average deposits per transaction for different regions, providing insights into regional player behavior.
- Identification of the fifth highest depositor on a specific date, highlighting key players.
- Comprehensive reporting on game popularity based on transaction counts, enabling better marketing and product decisions.
- Assessment of average deposits for specific conditions, such as players using certain skins (.dk) to understand market segments better.
